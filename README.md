Hello, 

Machine learning and AI is disrupting every business and IT domain, Cyber security is one such area. 
With the amount of data being generated in a modern Enterprise, Manual Security monitoring is both expensive and ineffective. 
AI could potentially augment the capabilities in SOC and help reducing manual monitoring effort. 

We will explore potential use cases for AI with in the Cyber security space, right from authentication to security event correlation and monitoring. 

If you have knowledge in either of the domains (AI / Cybersecurity) and keen to contribute, drop a note to info@reducton.com

Initially we will be explore the following use cases

* Risk based Authentication

* Context driven security event correlation 

* Network Anamoly Detection

* Privilege escalation detection

* Compliance Risk Monitoring
